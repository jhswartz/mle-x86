MLE-X86(7)                       Macro Library                      MLE-X86(7)

NAME
       mle-x86 - x86 relative offset calculation macros for mle

DESCRIPTION
       mle-x86  is  a macro library for the mle(1) encoder that provides func‐
       tions to calculate 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit relative offsets  for  use
       in x86 (and amd64) branch instructions.

INTEGRATION
       To  use  these  macros in an mle source file, include the library using
       the dot operator at the beginning of your source:

       [ . x86 ]

MACROS
       The following macros accept a single argument, LABEL, which must  be  a
       valid mle label (forward or backward reference).

       rel8 LABEL
              Calculates an 8-bit signed relative offset.

       rel16 LABEL
              Calculates a 16-bit signed little-endian relative offset.

       rel32 LABEL
              Calculates a 32-bit signed little-endian relative offset.

INSTALLATION
       The library file x86 should be placed in the shared mle directory so it
       can be found by the encoder's import  search  path.  The  best  way  to
       achieve  this  is to ensure mle-x86 setup shares the same PREFIX as the
       local mle installation.

       Default Location
              /usr/local/share/mle/x86

EXAMPLE
       The following mli-amd64(1) program demonstrates the  use  of  rel8  for
       conditional loops and branching.
